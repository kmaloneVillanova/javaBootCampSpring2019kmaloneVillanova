# Java Boot Camp Git Demo

In this demo we will clone the repositories given to us.
Everyone will create a unique file and push it to their repo to practice add, commit and push commands.
Then we will clone Kathleen's repo and create and push a classInfo.txt file with everyone's name and github username. We will all have to edit this single file so we'll get some practice with the merge command.
